<pre>
`webpack main.js bundle.js` for building once for development
`webpack -p main.js bundle.min.js` for building once for production (minification)
`webpack --watch main.js bundle.min.js` for continuous incremental build in development (fast!)
`webpack -d main.js bundle.js` to include source maps (note: check the 'Source' tab of the chrome developer tool)
